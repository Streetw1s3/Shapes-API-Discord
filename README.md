# Shapes-API-Discord
Since Discord banned Shapes from the platform I decided to make a self hosted node.js Discord chat bot designed to work with Shapes.inc API. 
This should comply with their ToS now as you are hosting your own API key and such, but to be on the safe side there's no references to Shapes between the bot and Discord itself.

Just install dependancies, edit the .env with your relevent bot info, edit index.js to change what the bot is playing.

! commands mentioned in their API doc now also work as / commands just as they used to. Some commands like !help, !dashboard, and !info have not been converted into slash commands and are not recommended to use since they would show info from Shapes.

Shape voices and image generation works just as you remember it.

Enjoy!
